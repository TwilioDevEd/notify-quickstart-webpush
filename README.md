# Twilio Notify Quickstart for Web Push

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own web push app with Twilio Notify. Before we begin, you will need to set up a
web server application that communicates with your web application and Twilio Notify backend.

## Download a Twilio SDK Starter Server project

You can download one of the web server application in these languages:

| Language  | GitHub Repo |
| :-------------  |:------------- |
PHP | [sdk-starter-php](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-php/)
Ruby | [sdk-starter-ruby](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-ruby/)
Python | [sdk-starter-python](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-python/)
Node.js | [sdk-starter-node](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-node/)
Java | [sdk-starter-java](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-java/)

You'll only need to download one of those. Not sure which one to choose?
The [Node.js](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sdk-starter-node/) server starter kit
is pretty easy to set up and follow along with.

Follow the directions in the README on one of the above servers, and get the web server up
and running to make sure you have everything configured right for the demos you are interested in.

## Setting up the application

*TBD soon !*
